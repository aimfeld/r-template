# Introduction

This template gives you a starting point for structuring a datascience project using R markdown. Having chapters in separate files facilitates collaboration and version control. Also, each chapter imports the same [Knitr_setup.Rmd](Knitr_setup.Rmd) file, so you can knit individual chapters or the whole document [Main.Rmd](Main.Rmd). Make sure you can knit your chapter independently, because knitting your main document will become slower as your project grows.

The template renders html files, but it's easy to change it to pdf.
